# Bytecode VM Architecture Plan

## Summary
Continue building the bytecode VM for D behind the existing
`Bytecode` backend. The VM compiles semantically analyzed D ASTs into an
internal bytecode artifact and executes it in-process, with no object files
and no linker on the hot path.

Product goal:

1. Minimise the latency from an edit in the project under test (not
   necessarily in its dub dependencies) to a yes/no "did the relevant tests
   pass?" answer. Parse and semantic analysis are fixed costs. This plan
   covers the execution engine only: compiling from the AST and running.
   Bytecode artifact caching and affected-test selection are separate, later
   plans; this design must not preclude them but does not deliver them.

The VM targets all of D and is held to one oracle: compiled D.

**Deferred (out of scope):** serving as a replacement for the DMD CTFE
engine. That goal implied a per-backend CTFE-only/full-D mode and a second
(CTFE) oracle; both are dropped (`ai/plans/single-oracle.md`). Revisit only
if the current CTFE engine is actually replaced, at which point a
CTFE-faithful mode and its legality/diagnostics matching can be re-specified
from scratch. The design must not *preclude* that swap (see "Re-entrancy"
below), but it is not built for now.

Correctness overrides the goal: the VM must have the same observable
semantics as if the source had been compiled to native code and run. Fast
but wrong is worthless.

## Oracle
- The single oracle is really-compiled code, via `SystemLinker`
  (`ai/plans/single-oracle.md`). The arbiter for any observable behaviour,
  including failure message text, is a real
  `dmd -unittest -checkaction=context` compile-and-run of the fixture, byte
  for byte, following `dmd-backend.md`'s `SystemLinker` contract.
- `Ctfe` is not an oracle. Where `Ctfe` diverges from `SystemLinker` (e.g.
  the static-array-copy aliasing quirk), the VM produces the
  compiled-D result and the divergence is characterized against `Ctfe`,
  not emulated.
- Re-entrancy (keeping the deferred CTFE swap possible): the VM core is
  re-entrant with no global mutable state, entry is per-`FuncDeclaration`
  rather than per-module, and results are reachable as raw memory plus a
  static type, so they can be reified as a DMD `Expression` just as well as
  a `quickbite.lang.Value`.

## Core Architecture

### Memory model: native layout over real memory
This is the load-bearing decision; everything else follows from it.

- The VM is a virtual CPU executing D-level operations on real host memory
  laid out exactly as compiled code would lay it out. DMD semantic analysis
  has already computed every size, alignment, and field offset
  (`Type.size()`, `Type.alignsize()`, `VarDeclaration.offset`); the bytecode
  compiler reuses those numbers and never invents its own layout.
- A call frame is a contiguous byte region. Every local lives at its native
  offset with its native size; compiler-generated temporaries are additional
  typed frame slots assigned at emit time. Instructions address frame byte
  offsets — a register machine whose registers are frame memory.
- Consequences, all by construction rather than by special cases: taking the
  address of a local yields a real pointer; pointer arithmetic, aliasing,
  slices into locals, unions, and reinterpret casts behave exactly as native
  code does. This eliminates the whole class of deviations the tree-walking
  interpreter's pointer-snapshot model is known for.
- Pointer metadata keeps opcode scalar type and native element byte stride as
  separate facts. Aggregate pointees use the non-scalar opcode marker, but
  stepping and slicing still use DMD's size of the immediate pointed-at type
  (`int[]*` advances by a slice descriptor and `S*` by `S.sizeof`). Never infer
  byte stride from the scalar opcode type.
- Known native-layout violation to fix: the VM's slice descriptor
  (`writeSliceDescriptor`) is `{ptr, length}`, but compiled D lays a slice out
  as `{length, ptr}` (length at offset 0). The FFI bridge already matches real
  D and word-swaps at the boundary (`readResult`/`fillArgument`). Flip the VM
  descriptor to native order and delete both swaps; until then, any pointer to
  a descriptor crossing the bridge unswapped (`int[]*`, a struct with a slice
  field passed by reference) reads ptr-as-length on the native side. The flip
  touches every descriptor read/write site (`subSlice*`, `indexLoad*`, bounds
  checks; the compact string descriptor should flip for consistency) and needs
  a bridge round-trip test of a struct containing a slice field.
- Heap: interpreted data structures are native data structures
  and the host GC owns the heap. The druntime lowering hooks are templates
  (`_d_newclassT!T`, `_d_arrayappendT`, `_d_aaGetY`) instantiated into the
  project's compilation, so the VM executes their bodies like any other
  available source; only the leaves (`GC.malloc` and friends) are native
  calls, and those leaves consume runtime type metadata for VM-compiled
  types — see below. VM stack memory is registered with the host GC so
  references held in frames keep objects alive; conservative scanning of
  large frame regions (false-pointer pinning) and `addRange`/`removeRange`
  churn are known costs the bench checkpoints must watch.

### Runtime type metadata
Native-layout memory is not enough for the druntime leaves; they also
consume type metadata that compiled code gets from the code generator:

- `GC.malloc(size, attrs, typeid(T))` needs a live native `TypeInfo` object
  per allocated type; GC finalization reads the destructor pointer from it,
  at an arbitrary later collection point.
- `_d_newclassT!C` copies the vtable from `__traits(initSymbol, C)` — a
  static data blob that does not exist for VM-compiled classes.
- Array append calls `elem.__xpostblit()` directly; the template AA calls
  `key.toHash()`/`opEquals` directly. For VM-compiled types those function
  pointers must point at VM entry thunks.

So the VM synthesizes native `TypeInfo`/`TypeInfo_Class` instances,
init blobs, and vtables for VM-compiled types, with function-pointer slots
(dtor, postblit, copy ctor, toHash, opEquals) filled by inbound VM entry
thunks. "The real runtime manipulates the real heap" holds without this
metadata only for POD element/key types. Because GC finalization can fire
long after the allocating call, thunk lifetime is tied to the VM session,
not the call.

Exposing tests (compiled oracle): append to an array of a
struct with a postblit; `new` a class with `~this()`, drop the reference,
`GC.collect()`, assert the dtor ran; an AA keyed on a struct with a custom
`toHash`.

### Module-level state
- Each module gets a VM-owned data segment with native layout — sizes,
  alignments, and offsets from DMD, the same authority as frames. Segments
  are GC-registered like stack chunks.
- `static this()` runs before the first access to the module's state,
  ordered by druntime's cycle-checked import-graph semantics. This is an
  eager per-module obligation layered on lazy per-function compilation: the
  first call into a module triggers its (and its imports') constructors
  before the called function body runs.
- TLS: the VM executes single-threaded for now, so TLS and `__gshared`
  coincide. This is an explicit assumption, recorded with the
  concurrency-readiness constraints.

Exposing test (compiled oracle): a module containing
`int counter; static this() { counter = 40; }` and
`int bump() { return counter += 2; }`, with a unittest asserting
`bump() == 42`. This forces segment storage, constructor-before-first-access
ordering, and function-level rather than unittest-body visibility of the
global.

### No universal runtime value type
- `quickbite.lang.Value` must not appear in the bytecode compiler, the
  bytecode format, or the VM. Every operand's type is static; the compiler
  selects type-specialised opcodes at emit time from the semantic type, and
  no handler dispatches on a runtime tag.
- `Value` is constructed in exactly one place: the `Evaluator` boundary,
  where the final result is reified from frame memory plus its static type,
  the way a debugger renders memory using type metadata. `Runner` needs no
  `Value` at all — pass/fail plus diagnostic strings.
- `ai/plans/value.md` defines the `Evaluator` contract as a rendered display
  string. Boundary reification is private interim scaffolding to delete once
  this backend executes the in-program formatter prelude.

### Display-scaffolding deletion inventory
The interim display scaffolding below is scheduled for deletion when the
prelude formatter lands on this backend (`ai/plans/value.md` decisions 3/4).
Do not add cases, types, or metadata to any of it.
If a test can only pass by extending one of these, the test waits for
formatter execution rather than growing the scaffolding.

- `source/quickbite/backends/evaluator.d`: the shared
  `displayString(Value, ...)` interim renderer — deleted with the formatter
  wiring (`value.md` remaining-work item 2).
- `source/quickbite/backends/bytecode/core/compiler.d`:
  `structDisplayField` display metadata (nullable pointer / delegate /
  class-reference field kinds) and the `ResultType` enum value-name maps.
- `source/quickbite/backends/bytecode/core/reify.d`: display-only `Value`
  construction — `Value.structDisplayValue`, `Value.enumValue`, the
  `Value.stringValue` width variants, and nullable-field `Value.null_` /
  `Value.undisplayable` rendering.

Reification itself — reading frame bytes at a static type at the
`Evaluator` boundary — is not deprecated; it remains a debugging instrument.
What is deprecated is growing its *display* vocabulary: any
rendering knowledge beyond "these bytes at this type".

### Bytecode format
- Fixed-width instructions: opcode plus up to three 16-bit operands (frame
  byte offsets, constant-pool indices, function ids, jump targets). Frames
  larger than the 16-bit range get an explicit wide escape rather than a
  variable-width format.
- The constant pool holds raw bits and strings, never `Value`. Diagnostic
  strings (assert messages, uninitialized-variable names) are pool entries
  referenced by index, not instruction payloads.
- A compiled function records: code, frame size and layout, parameter
  metadata, exception handler table, and a bytecode-offset-to-source-line
  table. The artifact is deterministic to emit and easy to disassemble so
  failures and cache behaviour are reproducible.
- Functions compile lazily: a function body is compiled the first time it is
  called. An edit therefore pays compilation cost only for code the executed
  tests actually reach. The artifact stays closed over the code the current
  test slice executes, not every transitive dependency.

### Execution core
- Frames are carved from VM-owned contiguous stack chunks; max frame size is
  known at compile time. Growth goes through the allocator or reports a
  deterministic call-stack exhaustion diagnostic.
- Dispatch starts as `final switch` over the opcode enum. Handler boundaries
  stay compatible with a function-pointer table or computed-goto upgrade so
  direct threading is a measurement-driven swap, not a rewrite.
- The interpreter core stays small and direct: explicit frame bookkeeping,
  no abstraction stack between the dispatch loop and memory.

### Native bridge
- The boundary is the body-less leaf, not package ownership: native means
  `fbody is null` — C libraries and separately compiled extern symbols.
  Everything with available source is executed by the VM, including
  druntime and Phobos template bodies instantiated with project types
  (`xs.map!(x => x * 2)` has no precompiled body anywhere). Stated plainly:
  the VM will interpret large swaths of Phobos, which raises the feature
  floor for the latency goal — ranges, capturing lambdas, classes, and
  exceptions arrive with the first `std.algorithm`-using test, regardless of
  slice order.
- Reconciliation with `ffi.md`: that document prescribes wrapper thunks for
  dependency calls, classifies mixed template instantiations as
  backend-executed or separately cached, and lists direct extern(D) calls
  as a non-goal. Native layout supersedes the wrapper position for this
  backend — data crosses the boundary unchanged, so per-signature wrapper
  codegen buys nothing. `ffi.md` §23 records this amendment; the wrapper
  design stands for boxed-value backends only.
- Druntime lowering hooks (`_d_arrayappendT`, the AA runtime,
  `_d_newclassT`, ...) are templates whose bodies the VM executes; the
  native leaves they bottom out in require the runtime type metadata
  described in Core Architecture. Only POD element/key types work without
  it.
- Outbound call mechanism: layout identity removes data conversion, not the
  call itself. Invoking a native function whose signature is only known at
  VM runtime means implementing the SysV x86_64 calling convention —
  INTEGER/SSE struct classification, the hidden `sret` pointer for large
  returns, `real` via x87, variadics. The bridge builds libffi CIFs from
  DMD type signatures and caches them per bridge entry alongside symbol
  resolution. "No marshalling layer" is scoped to data representation:
  values cross unchanged; the call goes through a cached FFI descriptor.
  `real` in signatures is a known libffi hazard on x86_64 and gets explicit
  fixtures (matching the compiled oracle's `real` precision).
- Native argument slot stride is an addressing contract only: it is wide
  enough for the widest bridge value, but every emitter and marshaller reads
  or writes the argument's actual ABI width. Scalar constant loads must never
  use the stride as their copy width; for example, a null pointer writes
  `size_t.sizeof` bytes while an array descriptor writes two native words.
- Every outbound call carries an exception guard converting native
  `Throwable`s into VM unwinding (see Exception Handling); "pass values
  as-is" describes the arguments, not the call.
- Inbound calls (native code invoking a bytecode function: GC finalizers,
  AA key methods, vtable entries, function pointers, delegates handed to
  native APIs) need native entry points per bytecode function. Candidate
  mechanisms: a pre-generated thunk pool or libffi closures. The choice is
  forced by the druntime/AA slice — GC finalization and AA key methods need
  thunks before classes do (see Runtime type metadata) — not by the
  classes/vtable slice; the calling convention must not preclude either
  mechanism.
- The inbound trampoline is not a boxed marshalling layer. Native layout can
  let the trampoline bind native arguments directly to bytecode frame slots,
  hand existing slot addresses to the callee, and write the result straight
  back to the ABI return location. The trampoline is still required because
  native code can only call an executable address with the host ABI, while a
  bytecode callback is a VM callable plus context, frame setup, lifetime
  state, and re-entry rules. The trampoline supplies that native-callable
  address, recovers the callback identity, enters the bytecode machine, and
  handles ABI details such as hidden context/receiver/sret slots, argument
  order, narrow returns, and out/ref parameters.
- Exposing tests for the call mechanism (compiled oracle, byte
  for byte): call a precompiled extern function taking a 24-byte struct by
  value and returning one (forces memory-class classification and `sret`);
  the same with `real` in the signature.

### CTFE legality checking (deferred)
The checked-opcode / provenance-table machinery that made the VM match DMD
CTFE's legality and diagnostics existed only for the deferred CTFE-engine
replacement goal (`ai/plans/single-oracle.md`). It is out of scope: the VM
targets full D, emits unchecked operations, and `__ctfe` evaluates to
`false`. Re-specify checked execution from scratch if the CTFE-replacement
goal is ever revived.

### Concurrency readiness
- Multi-thread execution is implemented when a compiled-D behaviour requires
  simultaneous threads. Host runtime calls and single-thread concurrency
  state reached before then are ordinary VM implementation work. Keep the
  design ready: no module-level mutable VM state, one machine instantiable per
  thread, and heap and provenance structures designed to become shared-capable.
- Known exception to "no shared mutable state": the compile-on-first-call
  function cache is per-machine shared mutable state and needs a lock or
  per-thread compilation when threads arrive.
- Until then the VM executes single-threaded; TLS and `__gshared` coincide
  (see Module-level state).

### Boundaries
- DMD AST and semantic types are visible only to the compiler module; the
  bytecode format and VM consume bytecode-native ids and metadata only.
- Backends remain isolated from each other; the bytecode core shares nothing
  with the Interpreter or IR backends.

## Implementation Direction

The current `Bytecode` backend is the typed-frame, native-layout VM. Extend
that backend directly. There is no narrow promotion frontier: the product
target is arbitrary D code reached from real unittest blocks.

### Immediate gate: complete the existing Bytecode baseline

Before looking for gaps in an external project, make every applicable existing
in-repo `SystemLinker`-oracle test include `Bytecode` and pass. In particular:

- Every `Omit!(Bytecode, Because.unconfirmed, ...)` is implementation work in
  the current queue. It is not evidence that the useful promotion frontier has
  ended, nor permission to move on to an external benchmark.
- Promote one existing `SystemLinker`-backed row by deleting its Bytecode
  `Because.unconfirmed` omission. This matrix promotion is pre-approved.
  Observe the concrete red failure, implement the smallest general D semantic
  that makes the row pass, verify the suite, and repeat.
- Phobos, druntime, `File`, `Random`, `Concurrency`, lazy structs,
  archive-backed imports, and FFI are normal ways arbitrary D unittest code
  reaches the VM. Unsupported constructs on those paths are expected VM work.
  A broad dependency path may be decomposed into bounded language or runtime
  semantics, but it must not be dismissed as speculative merely because it is
  broad.
- Keep every enabled Bytecode row green. `ninja bin/ut` and repeated
  `bin/ut --random` runs must be green and stable. An order-dependent crash or
  hang is a blocker to reproduce with the reported seed and fix; it is not
  acceptable handoff noise.
- `cerealed.arrayTooShortExceptionMessageIncludesBytes.Bytecode` is the one
  remaining red enabled row (`std.conv.text` rendering a `ubyte[]` into an
  exception message through `std.array.Appender`). Struct-by-value native
  returns now work in general (`tryCompileNativeCall`'s return-type gate
  accepts `TY.Tstruct`; `emitNativeCall` allocates the destination at the
  struct's own size/alignment, the same shape a non-native struct-by-value
  call result already uses, see `structBaseOffsetOrMaterialise`;
  `BytecodeNativeMarshaller` (`backends/bytecode/core/machine.d`) hands
  libffi the destination frame slot directly as the struct's own resultAddress
  rather than the narrow-scalar padded-buffer path), so `GC.qalloc`'s
  `BlkInfo` return compiles and `GC.extend`/`GC.qalloc` no longer block the
  row. The nested-function `this`-receiver capture described under Closures
  landed (`capturedThisStructDeclaration` now recognises any nested function
  with a `vthis`, not only `FuncLiteralDeclaration`, and
  `methodReceiverOffset` has a receiver branch for a direct unqualified call
  whose callee is a plain `VarExp` naming such a function), so
  `std.array.Appender.reserve`'s block-extend path (a plain nested named
  function reading `this`) no longer throws "Unsupported expression in
  bytecode core: this". The row is now blocked on `DivAssignExp` (`x /= y`),
  which has no compiler support at all today (only add/sub/mul/shr/shl/or
  compound-assign are wired, and unlike those, div/mod need a signed-vs-
  unsigned opcode choice per DMD's `divInt8`/`divUnsignedInt8`/
  `modUnsignedInt8` split rather than one opcode pair reused across both
  signedness cases); reproduces standalone as the row's own `text(...,
  needed, ...)` digit-formatting path, surfacing as "Unsupported expression
  in bytecode core: value /= 10LU". Once that lands the row may next reach:
  4-byte unsigned (`uint`) addition, unsupported because the narrow-int
  addition fallback hardcodes a signed-`int` result instead of using the
  expression's own scalar type the way its `or`/`and`/`xor` siblings already
  do; and inlining a void IIFE whose body is a single expression statement
  (Phobos's common `(() @trusted { ... })()` escape idiom), the same way a
  single-`return` IIFE already inlines. Those were observed downstream in a
  prior pass and are unconfirmed until `DivAssignExp` lands; a further,
  still-unisolated crash (an out-of-bounds `copySlice` while `Appender.put`
  assigns into a grown buffer) appeared after fixing them then, so at least
  one more gap remains beyond this list.
- Landing struct-by-value native returns exposed a latent cache bug in the
  shared FFI layer (`ffi/core.d`'s `callViaLibffi`): on a `cachedNativeCif`
  hit, the return buffer's size was read from the current call's freshly
  built (never `ffi_prep_cif`-ed) `ffi_type`, not the cached, already-prepped
  one (`preparedReturnFfi`); a struct return's size defaults to zero until
  prepped, so any call after the one that populated the cache undersized its
  return buffer. This is backend-agnostic (the cache is keyed by
  `FuncDeclaration`, shared process-wide across every backend), and was only
  ever latent because no marshaller drove a struct return through the cached
  path more than once until Bytecode started calling `div`/`ldiv`/`GC.qalloc`
  alongside the Interpreter/SystemLinker/LLVMJit tests that already did.
  Fixed by sizing the buffer from `preparedReturnFfi` instead.
- Do not run `bench.sh --dub cerealed` to discover the next gap until this
  complete existing Bytecode baseline is enabled and green. Once the baseline
  is complete, Cerealed is the next real-project gate. Distil each benchmark
  failure into the smallest D-language fixture backed by `SystemLinker`, then
  follow the normal approval rule before adding or changing that test.

Continue through the remaining `Because.unconfirmed` queue in this order,
re-reading the matrices before each promotion because the source may have
changed:

1. `stdConvTextRendersCharArrayExpressionRaw.Bytecode`: the `std.array` and
   `std.conv.text` dependency path over an exception message character array.
2. `decodeLazyForwardedRangeErrorSeesReaderState.Bytecode`: repeated forwarded
   lazy evaluation over a mutating struct-typed caller local.
3. `runTests.archiveBackedImportLinksFromArchive.Bytecode`: resolve and call
   the separately compiled archive symbol instead of compiling the rewritten
   source body.
4. `file.createWriteRead.Bytecode`: the `std.stdio.File` and `std.file`
   host-filesystem path.
5. `random.unpredictableSeedReadsNonRootInitializer.Bytecode`: imported
   Phobos module initialization and the host entropy path.
6. `concurrency.thisTid.Bytecode`: non-root Phobos class construction and the
   host concurrency/runtime path reached by `thisTid`.

This list is a starting order, not a substitute for repository discovery.
After it is empty, search all backend matrices and characterization pins for
remaining Bytecode exclusions. Preserve only exclusions that are genuine
oracle characterizations or architectural non-goals with an explicit reason.
An unsupported implementation is not, by itself, a permanent divergence from
the compiled-D oracle.

Reconfirm these live aggregate limitations against the current source when a
row reaches them:

- Scalar slice fill is limited to 4-byte basic elements; other widths,
  aggregate elements, and static-array slice fills still need general
  semantics.
- Dynamic-array sub-slices reject an upper bound beyond the source length;
  pointer-slice bounds and lower-bound diagnostics remain incomplete.
- Captured array support does not yet cover every read, write, slice, append,
  view-preservation, and closure combination.
- Struct aliases and whole-local assignment do not yet cover all heap fields,
  pointer receivers, captured structs, postblits, and `opAssign` semantics.
- Static arrays of dynamic arrays copy each element's full 16-byte slice
  descriptor; nested mutation and general stale-cell reconciliation remain
  incomplete.

### TDD and handoff discipline

- Promote one named existing oracle-backed row, or one tightly related family,
  at a time. A new test or a change to test behaviour still requires approval
  before editing the test.
- Start from the row's observed failure, not a predicted implementation. Make
  the smallest honest implementation that expresses the required D semantic;
  do not add backend-specific fixture workarounds.
- Broad library paths should be reduced into sequential semantic rungs. Use
  the candidate promotion as an uncommitted red integration target. If it
  cannot turn green in one bounded change, leave its matrix omission in place
  while approved smaller fixtures force reusable prerequisites, then promote
  the integration row in the commit that makes it green.
- Work serially in `source/quickbite/backends/bytecode/core/**`; adjacent
  features converge on the compiler, machine, and program modules. Parallel
  work belongs only to file-disjoint tracks such as `ai/plans/value.md` and
  `ai/plans/ffi.md`.
- After each editing session, run the repository-mandated
  `ninja bin/ut` and `bin/ut --random`. Replay a failing random order with its
  `--seed` before deciding whether the failure is related.
- A plan update names the next concrete failing row or semantic so another
  implementer does not duplicate work. Remove resolved queue entries instead
  of recording what prior changes did. Git history is that record.
  Do not make a plan-only boundary commit to avoid implementation work.

### Architecture work forced by the baseline

The row-driven loop determines the exact order, but the remaining dependency
paths are expected to exercise these architectural fronts:

1. Complete arrays, pointers, capacity, and lifetime semantics using real
   native-layout storage and aliases.
2. Execute available Phobos and druntime source, including templates,
   delegates, closures, classes, exceptions, and module initialization.
3. Widen the outbound native bridge for body-less leaves, aggregate returns,
   host resources, and archive symbols. Keep the bytecode-owned work in this
   plan and coordinate shared FFI seam work through `ai/plans/ffi.md`.
4. Synthesize runtime type metadata and inbound VM entry thunks when druntime,
   callbacks, finalizers, associative-array methods, or virtual dispatch force
   them.
5. Support the host-facing runtime needed by `File`, entropy, and concurrency
   while keeping the VM core re-entrant and free of module-level mutable state.

These are implementation areas, not reasons to postpone a promoted row. A
broad row may require several prerequisite commits, each ending with a green
enabled matrix and a forward-looking next-row update.

### REPL and formatter ownership

`tests/ut/bin/repl.d` is parity work against the existing interactive backend
behaviour and currently has no `SystemLinker` rows. It does not take precedence
over the baseline gate above.

Rendered-value REPL rows are earned by executing
`__quickbiteFormat` (`quickbite.repl_prelude`) as ordinary D, not by extending
the interim `Value` display vocabulary. `ai/plans/value.md` owns the shared
formatter contract and the non-bytecode formatter wiring. This plan owns the D
semantics needed for the bytecode VM to execute that formatter. Non-display
REPL behaviour remains ordinary bytecode work once the oracle-backed baseline
and Cerealed gate no longer expose earlier gaps.

### General implementation constraints

- Keep DMD AST and semantic types in the compiler boundary. The bytecode
  program representation and machine must use bytecode-native ids and
  metadata.
- Keep the backend adapter, compiler, program representation, and machine
  separate. Do not hide bytecode logic in the adapter.
- Preserve a strict semantic-AST-to-bytecode-to-execution pipeline. Do not add
  an IR pass; unittest compilation latency is on the hot path.
- Keep unsupported behaviour explicit and diagnostic while it is outside the
  currently promoted row. Never silently lower, guess, or emulate `Ctfe` when
  it differs from compiled D.
- Admit an inline-asm subset only from a frontend-preserved stream containing
  every token's kind and spelling, with exact whole-instruction-sequence
  validation. Punctuation, size qualifiers, memory operands, literals, and
  extra instructions must not collapse into a supported identifier shape.
- Do not infer code structure from source text. Ask the frontend for structured
  cells, declarations, statements, and expressions.
- Make opcodes and metadata earn their shape from a behaviour. Prefer existing
  typed operations over one-off language-operation opcodes when their
  semantics are identical.
- Arithmetic and comparison handlers may use compiler-selected typed opcode
  variants where static selection removes runtime type dispatch.
- Derive builtin identity mechanically from DMD's semantic classification;
  do not duplicate mangling conventions or maintain a list of guessed symbol
  spellings.
- Treat bytecode as an internal artifact, not a public serialization format or
  compatibility promise.
- Preserve the architecture's explicit CTFE-engine-replacement deferral,
  AST/compiler boundary, native-layout model, backend isolation, and
  measurement-driven optimization rules. Do not invent a narrow-slice product
  boundary that conflicts with running arbitrary D unittest code.

## Verification

- Use public behaviour tests for D semantics and backend parity.
- Use focused VM contract tests only for bytecode-specific properties such as
  operand typing, frame behaviour, and diagnostic boundaries.
- Compare language behaviour and diagnostic text with `SystemLinker`, byte for
  byte. Characterize `Ctfe` separately when it diverges.
- Verify a promoted row red before production changes and green afterward.
- Run `ninja bin/ut`, then `bin/ut --random`, after each editing session. Use
  the reported seed for any failure investigation.
- Run `ci.sh` before creating a PR. Do not accept a benchmark failure merely
  because the current PR advances only part of the full VM.

## Performance

- Correctness and baseline stability precede optimization.
- Measure post-parse execution against `SystemLinker` and the project
  benchmarks at meaningful semantic checkpoints.
- Optional bytecode peephole optimization is the first optimization candidate
  after measurement justifies it. Keep it runtime-togglable so the same body
  of D code can compare optimized and unoptimized bytecode.
- Do not seal or hash emitted bytecode before an optional optimization pass can
  run.
- Keep the interpreter dispatch compatible with a measurement-driven switch
  from `final switch` to direct threading without requiring a bytecode-format
  rewrite.

## Builtins and Native Calls

- Builtin parity (`sqrt`, `fabs`, and similar operations) stays mechanically
  tied to DMD's builtin classification and is executed by the VM.
- Druntime lowerings with available source execute as D bytecode. Body-less
  leaves use the native bridge.
- Native-layout values cross the bridge unchanged. Cached libffi descriptors
  perform the call; bridge entries cache typed signatures, CIFs, and symbol
  resolution.
- Native `Throwable`s crossing the boundary are converted to VM unwinding, and
  VM exceptions crossing an inbound thunk become native unwinding.

## Exception Handling

- Each compiled function artifact carries a handler table.
- Handler records include their protected range, kind, optional caught type,
  optional catch-binding slot, catch order, and enough continuation metadata
  for `finally` to resume throw, return, branch, or normal fallthrough.
- The VM selects a handler or unwinds the frame on throw and assert failure. D
  exceptions must not propagate silently through every interpreter frame.
- Thrown objects are real `Throwable` instances on the host heap.

## Debug Information

Maintain bytecode-offset-to-source-line mappings sufficient for compiled-D
assertion diagnostics. Add variable-name tables only when an active debugger
or REPL behaviour requires them.

## Constant Pool

Deduplicate constants within the VM session, compilation batch, or artifact
cache generation. Give the intern table allocator-owned lifetime plus explicit
reset or invalidation. Cross-artifact interning must use the same key and
lifetime as the dependency bytecode cache.

## Closures

- Captured variables live in a GC-heap closure environment addressed through
  an environment pointer, matching DMD's computed capture set and native
  layout. Non-captured locals remain frame slots.
- Do not add dynamic open/closed-upvalue machinery; DMD semantic analysis has
  already determined `needsClosure()` and `closureVars`.
- Native callbacks that receive delegates use the inbound trampoline described
  under Native bridge.
- A nested function that reads its enclosing struct method's `this` (a
  capturing lambda literal, e.g. `() => this.field`, or a plain nested named
  function, e.g. `auto helper() { return this.field; }`) needs a hidden
  `this` receiver, not a captured-locals environment: DMD gives both shapes
  an identical `vthis` context pointer (`FuncDeclaration.isNested`, set for
  any non-`static` function whose `toParent2` is a function, regardless of
  whether it is a `FuncLiteralDeclaration`), and `ThisExp` resolution inside
  either one resolves to the nearest enclosing method's own `vthis`
  (`hasThis(sc)` walking up through nested scopes). The compiler recognises
  this case (`capturedThisStructDeclaration`) for both shapes, keyed only on
  `vthis` plus the enclosing parent being a struct method; a direct
  unqualified call to such a named nested function gets a call-site receiver
  branch in `methodReceiverOffset` for the plain `VarExp` callee shape,
  alongside the `DotVarExp`/`FuncExp` shapes. This is a `this`-receiver
  question, not the captured-locals-environment work above, and does not by
  itself require a closure environment. A lambda that captures a plain
  enclosing *local* (not `this`) remains unmodelled and does need the
  captured-locals environment described above; an immediately-invoked void
  lambda whose body is a single expression statement can avoid needing that
  environment by inlining the statement into the caller the same way a
  single-`return`-expression IIFE already inlines.

The compiled-D exposing behaviour is:

```d
int local = 1;
auto f = () => local;
local = 2;
assert(f() == 2);
```

Any copy or snapshot representation of the captured local fails this
behaviour.

## Assumptions and Explicit Deferrals

- AST-first lowering from semantically analysed DMD ASTs remains the starting
  point. Direct parser-to-bytecode generation is out of scope.
- The VM is optimized for unittest latency, not long-running throughput. JIT
  compilation remains a future experiment because its compile cost works
  against this goal.
- Linux x86_64 is the first host target. Other targets follow the host ABI
  through the same DMD layout queries and bridge abstraction.
- Replacing DMD's CTFE engine remains out of scope. Checked CTFE legality,
  CTFE-specific diagnostics, and a second execution mode are not part of this
  VM.
- Multi-thread execution may remain deferred until a compiled-D behaviour
  requires multiple simultaneous threads. Host runtime calls and single-thread
  concurrency state already reached by existing rows are not covered by that
  deferral.
- String/array-slice truthiness (`if (s)`, `!s`, `s ? a : b`, `s && t`, plain
  `assert(s)`) is D's `ptr !is null`, but the compact 8-byte {data offset,
  length} slice descriptor a string local or field carries cannot distinguish
  null from data-at-offset-zero. `compileBoolCondition` refuses any
  string-typed condition by its AST type before compiling it, rather than
  trust every operand producer to have set `Operand.isString`: a `string[N]`
  element read yields a 16-byte chunk at the same stride an ordinary `T[][N]`
  element uses, but it is not a genuine native {ptr, length} slice descriptor
  there — it is still the compact 8-byte {data offset, length} descriptor
  followed by 8 zero-padding bytes, so it cannot carry that flag without
  corrupting other consumers (`.length`, `==`) that branch on it to mean the
  compact layout. Implementing real truthiness
  needs a faithful string-null model (a descriptor or convention that can
  represent "no data" distinctly from "data at offset 0") applied consistently
  across the compiler, and would need to account for both descriptor layouts
  in play, not a local fix in one place.
